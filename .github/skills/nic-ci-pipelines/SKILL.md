# NIC CI/CD Pipelines

## Workflow Architecture

The CI system uses GitHub Actions with extensive **reusable workflow** composition.

```text
ci.yml (main CI orchestrator)
  -> checks (format, lint, codegen, CRDs, chart version)
  -> unit-tests
  -> build-artifacts.yml (reusable)
       -> build-oss.yml (per-variant, matrix)
       -> build-plus.yml (per-variant, matrix)  <- also used for NAP variants
  -> helm-tests
  -> setup-smoke.yml (reusable)
  -> e2e tests

image-promotion.yml (post-merge)
  -> builds images, tags edge/stable
  -> Trivy + DockerScout security scans
  -> publishes edge Helm charts

release.yml (manual dispatch)
  -> oss-release.yml
  -> plus-release.yml
  -> publish-helm.yml
  -> certify-ubi-image.yml
  -> marketplace pushes (AWS, Azure, GCP)
```

## Key Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | PR to `main`/`release-*`, merge_group, workflow_dispatch | Main CI: checks + build + test |
| `lint-format.yml` | PR to `main`, merge_group | goimports, gofumpt, golangci-lint, actionlint |
| `regression.yml` | Daily cron (03:00 UTC), manual | Multi-K8s-version regression |
| `image-promotion.yml` | Push to `main`/`release-*` | Post-merge image tagging + scanning |
| `release.yml` | Manual dispatch | Full release orchestrator |
| `build-base-images.yml` | Weekday cron (04:30 UTC) | Rebuilds all base images |

### Release Sub-Workflows (called by `release.yml`)

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `oss-release.yml` | OSS image release |
| `plus-release.yml` | Plus/NAP image release |
| `publish-helm.yml` | Helm chart publishing to registry |

### Reusable Build Workflows (called via `workflow_call`)

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `build-artifacts.yml` | Orchestrates GoReleaser binary builds + image matrix |
| `build-oss.yml` | Builds single OSS image variant |
| `build-plus.yml` | Builds single Plus/NAP image variant |
| `build-test-image.yml` | Builds Python e2e test image |
| `setup-smoke.yml` | Sets up and runs smoke tests |
| `patch-image.yml` | OS-level patches on existing images |
| `retag-images.yml` | Re-tags images in GCR Dev Registry |

### Security & Compliance

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `codeql-analysis.yml` | GitHub CodeQL scanning |
| `scorecards.yml` | OpenSSF Scorecards |
| `dependency-review.yml` | Dependency review for PRs |
| `mend.yml` | Mend (WhiteSource) software composition analysis |
| `certify-ubi-image.yml` | Red Hat UBI certification for OpenShift |

## CI Patterns

### Matrix Builds

Image variants are defined in JSON under `.github/data/`:

- `matrix-images-oss.json`: debian, alpine, ubi (amd64 + arm64)
- `matrix-images-plus.json`: debian-plus, alpine-plus, alpine-plus-fips, ubi-10-plus
- `matrix-images-nap.json`: WAF v4/v5, DoS, UBI 10 (amd64 only)
- `matrix-smoke-oss.json`, `matrix-smoke-plus.json`, `matrix-smoke-nap.json`: Smoke test matrices
- `matrix-regression.json`: Regression test matrix (K8s version combinations)
- `patch-images.json`: Patch image definitions for `patch-image.yml`

### Caching Strategy

- Go binaries: cached by `go_code_md5` hash
- Docker images: cached by `docker_md5` hash
- Stable images in GCR are checked before rebuilding

### Fork Awareness

`forked_workflow` variable gates authenticated operations. Forked PRs get local-only builds without secret access.

### Concurrency

Each workflow uses `group: ${{ github.ref_name }}-<suffix>` with `cancel-in-progress: true`.

### Secrets

Retrieved from Azure Key Vault via OIDC -- not stored as GitHub secrets directly.

### Version Source of Truth

`.github/data/version.txt` contains `IC_VERSION` and `HELM_CHART_VERSION`.

## Gotchas

- **Never** add secrets as GitHub repository secrets -- use Azure Key Vault OIDC flow
- **Always** pin GitHub Actions to immutable SHA hashes, not mutable tags
- Matrix JSON files in `.github/data/` must stay in sync with Makefile image targets
- NAP variants are `linux/amd64` only -- do not add `arm64` to NAP matrices
- Renovate manages tool versions via `# renovate:` comments -- do not update manually
- `image-promotion.yml` runs on merge to `main`, not on PR -- don't expect images from PRs
