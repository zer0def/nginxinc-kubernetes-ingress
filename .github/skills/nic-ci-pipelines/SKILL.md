# NIC CI/CD Pipelines

## Workflow Architecture

The CI system uses GitHub Actions with extensive **reusable workflow** composition.

```text
ci.yml (main CI orchestrator)
  -> checks (format, lint, codegen, CRDs, chart version)
  -> unit-tests, staticcheck, govulncheck
  -> build-artifacts.yml (reusable)
       -> build-oss.yml (per-variant, matrix)
       -> build-plus.yml (per-variant, matrix)  <- also used for NAP variants
  -> package-tests, helm-tests
  -> setup-smoke.yml (reusable)
  -> smoke / e2e tests

image-promotion.yml (post-merge)
  -> builds images, tags edge/stable
  -> Trivy + DockerScout security scans
  -> publishes edge Helm charts to GHCR
  -> updates GitHub Release draft notes

release-prep.yml (dispatchable Stage 1: Creation)
  -> build-artifacts.yml (reusable)
  -> push-prep-images -> stages images in docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com
  -> stage-helm-chart -> stages Helm chart in oci://docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com/nginx-ic/helm
  -> binaries -> generates SBOM (Syft), signs (Cosign), creates tarballs
  -> azure-upload -> uploads signed tarballs to Azure blob storage

release-publish.yml (dispatchable Stage 2: Publish)
  -> oss-release.yml (source_registry: docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com)
  -> plus-release.yml (source_registry: docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com)
  -> publish-helm.yml (publishes Helm chart to Helm repo & GHCR)
  -> certify-openshift-images (certifies UBI images on OpenShift / Pyxis)
  -> operator -> triggers nginx-ingress-helm-operator sync
  -> release-gate -> verifies all artifact publications succeed
  -> tag -> creates and pushes the vX.Y.Z git tag
  -> release-assets -> downloads tarballs from Azure and uploads to GitHub release draft
  -> github-release -> closes milestone and publishes the GitHub release draft
```

### Two-Stage Release Architecture

Release pipelines are split into two independently dispatchable stages:

1. **Stage 1 (Prep / Creation)** (`release-prep.yml` / `release-prep-lts.yml`):
   - Builds binaries and container images
   - Stages container images and Helm charts in the internal test registry (`docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com`)
   - Generates Syft SBOMs, signs artifacts with Cosign, and uploads release tarballs to Azure blob storage
   - Does **not** create git tags, publish public images, or publish the GitHub release
2. **Stage 2 (Publish)** (`release-publish.yml` / `release-publish-lts.yml`):
   - Copies prepped images from `docker-mgmt-test.nginx.com` to public registries (GCR, Docker Hub, ECR Public, Quay, GHCR, NGINX Registry)
   - Publishes public Helm charts and certifies UBI images on OpenShift
   - Verifies all prerequisites via `release-gate`
   - Creates and pushes the release git tag (`vX.Y.Z` or `<lts_version>`)
   - Downloads signed binaries from Azure blob storage and attaches them to the GitHub release draft
   - Closes the release milestone and publishes the GitHub release

Because the stages are decoupled, a transient failure in publishing or external registry sync can be retried directly via `release-publish.yml` without rebuilding any images or binaries.

## CI Patterns

### Matrix Builds

Image variants and test configurations are defined in JSON under `.github/data/`:

- `matrix-images-oss.json`: debian, alpine, ubi (amd64 + arm64)
- `matrix-images-plus.json`: debian-plus, alpine-plus, alpine-plus-fips, ubi-10-plus
- `matrix-images-plus-lts.json`: LTS Plus image definitions
- `matrix-images-nap.json`: WAF v4/v5, DoS, UBI 10 (amd64 only)
- `matrix-smoke-oss.json`, `matrix-smoke-plus.json`, `matrix-smoke-nap.json`: Smoke test matrices
- `matrix-regression.json`: Regression test matrix (K8s version combinations)
- `patch-images.json`, `patch-images-lts.json`: Patch image definitions for `patch-image.yml`

### Caching Strategy

- **Go binaries**: cached by `go_code_md5` hash (computed in `.github/scripts/variables.sh` over all `*.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `*.tmpl`, `version.txt`)
- **Docker images**: cached by `docker_md5` hash (computed over `build/`, `.github/data/version.txt`, `internal/configs/njs`, `internal/configs/oidc`)
- **Build tags**: `build_tag` (`t-<md5>`) and `stable_tag` (`s-<md5>`) determine image freshness
- Stable images in GCR Dev Registry are checked before rebuilding to prevent redundant Docker builds

### Change Detection & Optimization

- `docs_only` detection in `variables.sh` identifies PRs touching only docs (`*.md`, `docs/**`, `examples/**`) and skips expensive image builds and integration tests.

### Fork Awareness

- `forked_workflow` variable gates authenticated operations. Forked PRs get local-only builds without secret access.

### Concurrency

- CI workflows use `group: ${{ github.ref_name }}-<suffix>` with `cancel-in-progress: true`.
- Release workflows (`release-prep.yml` and `release-publish.yml`) share `group: ${{ inputs.release_branch }}-release` with `cancel-in-progress: false` to ensure a publish dispatch cannot overtake a prep in flight.
- LTS release workflows (`release-prep-lts.yml` and `release-publish-lts.yml`) share `group: ${{ inputs.release_branch }}-release-lts` with `cancel-in-progress: false`.

### Secrets & Authentication

- Secrets are retrieved from Azure Key Vault via `nginx/ci-self-hosted/.github/actions/get-from-vault` using OIDC / Workload Identity -- not stored directly as GitHub repository secrets.
- Google Cloud authentication uses Workload Identity Federation (`google-github-actions/auth`).

### Version Source of Truth

- `.github/data/version.txt` contains `IC_VERSION` and `HELM_CHART_VERSION`.

## Gotchas

- **Never** add secrets as GitHub repository secrets -- use Azure Key Vault OIDC flow via `get-from-vault` action
- **Always** pin GitHub Actions to immutable SHA hashes with version comments, not mutable tags
- Matrix JSON files in `.github/data/` must stay in sync with Makefile image targets
- NAP variants are `linux/amd64` only -- do not add `arm64` to NAP matrices
- Renovate manages tool versions via `# renovate:` comments -- do not update manually
- `image-promotion.yml` runs on merge to `main` and `release-*`, not on PR -- don't expect images from PRs
- Release-only workflows and `.github/config/config-*` files must be listed in `.github/scripts/exclude_ci_files.txt`, otherwise they feed `get_actions_md5()` and invalidate `stable_tag`, forcing a full image rebuild
- `.github/config/config-*` files are shared between `release-publish.yml`, `image-promotion.yml`, `regression.yml` and `update-docker-images.yml`. Never add a `SOURCE_*_IMAGE_PREFIX` override to one -- the other callers read from the dev registry and would break. Override `TARGET_*` only
- Every job in a non-`mirror-*` workflow must be gated as `github.repository == 'nginx/kubernetes-ingress'` (or `nginx/kubernetes-ingress-internal` for internal-only jobs like prep) optionally followed by `&& ( ... )` with **all** extra conditions inside one balanced group. `&&` binds tighter than `||`, so an ungrouped chain like `gate && (a) || (b)` parses as `(gate && (a)) || (b)` and would run on a fork. Enforced by `.github/scripts/validate-workflow-gating.sh` (pre-commit + `lint-format.yml`); run it locally after editing any job's `if`
- A job whose `if` contains `always()`, `!cancelled()` or `failure()` runs **even when a `needs` dependency failed**. Such jobs must assert every dependency explicitly (`needs.<job>.result == 'success'`), which is why the release jobs list results one by one
- Asserting a *downstream* job is not enough -- a dependency that failed leaves its dependants `skipped`, and `result == 'skipped'` is usually an accepted arm. Assert the job that actually does the work (e.g. `tag` asserts `release-gate`, `release-assets` asserts `variables`)
- `contains()` is a **substring** match, not a token match. Never gate on a value that is a prefix of another job name: `contains(skip_step, 'prep')` also matches `push-prep-images`, and `contains(skip_step, 'publish')` also matches `publish-helm-chart`
- `release-prep.yml` and `release-publish.yml` share the `<branch>-release` concurrency group so a publish dispatch cannot overtake a prep still writing to the staging registry (likewise for LTS release workflows sharing `<branch>-release-lts`)
- `copy-images.sh` resolves `SOURCE_REGISTRY`/`TARGET_REGISTRY` *after* sourcing `CONFIG_PATH`, so an explicit positional argument beats the config file. Pass the source registry as `$1`; let the config own `TARGET_REGISTRY`
- Jobs that publish externally visible artifacts must fail loudly when there is nothing to publish. `github-release` errors on a missing draft release **before** closing the milestone, so a green run guarantees a published release
