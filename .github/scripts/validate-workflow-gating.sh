# This is called from the lint-format.yml workflow file.
#
# Purpose of this is to make sure that every job in workflow files that don't start with
# "mirror-" have a gate that only runs them on the main repository (nginx/kubernetes-ingress).
#
# Workflow files starting with "mirror-" will be used in mirror repositories where slightly
# different workflows are needed due to access requirements and different jobs. Separating
# them into different files allows us to keep various branches up to date where we don't need
# to deal with merge conflicts in the workflow files.
#
# A job's `if:` condition is "correctly gated" when it has one of these shapes:
#
#     github.repository == 'nginx/kubernetes-ingress'
#     github.repository == 'nginx/kubernetes-ingress' && ( <extra conditions> )
#
# The gate must come first, and any extra conditions must be wrapped in a single
# balanced parenthesis group. GitHub Actions gives `&&` higher precedence than
# `||`, so without the single-group requirement a top-level `||` could bypass the
# gate, e.g. "gate && (a) || (b)" parses as "(gate && (a)) || (b)" and would run
# on a fork/mirror. (Unbalanced parentheses are rejected by GitHub Actions' own
# syntax validation, so we only guard against the balanced-but-bypassing case.)

# Returns 0 only if the entire string is one balanced parenthesis group,
# e.g. "(a && (b || c))". Rejects "(a) || (b)" (the first '(' closes before the
# end) and any unbalanced input.
