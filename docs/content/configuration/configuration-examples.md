Our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress) includes a number of configuration examples:
* [*Examples*](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.2.0/examples) show how to use advanced NGINX features in Ingress resources with annotations.
* [*Examples of Custom Resources*](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v2.2.0/examples/custom-resources) show how to use VirtualServer and VirtualServerResources for a few use cases.
