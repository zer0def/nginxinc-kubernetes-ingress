# Policy

**Group:** `k8s.nginx.org`  
**Version:** `v1`  
**Kind:** `Policy`  
**Scope:** `Namespaced`

## Description

The `Policy` resource defines a security policy for `VirtualServer` and `VirtualServerRoute` resources. It allows you to apply various policies such as access control, authentication, rate limiting, and WAF protection.

## Spec Fields

The `.spec` object supports the following fields:

| `cache.useTempPath` | `boolean` | UseTempPath controls whether temporary files and the cache are put on different file systems (use_temp_path parameter).

The server must specify explicit origins for credentialed requests. |
| `cors.exposeHeaders` | `array[string]` | ExposeHeaders defines the headers that browsers are allowed to access. Use this field to expose additional custom headers to the browser. Example: ["X-Total-Count", "X-Page-Size", "X-RateLimit-Remaining"] Note: Set-Cookie headers cannot be exposed via CORS per official MDN specification. |

| `rateLimit.scale` | `boolean` | Enables a constant rate-limit by dividing the configured rate by the number of nginx-ingress pods currently serving traffic. This adjustment ensures that the rate-limit remains consistent, even as the number of nginx-pods fluctuates due to autoscaling. This will not work properly if requests from a client are not evenly distributed across all ingress pods (Such as with sticky sessions, long lived TCP Connections with many requests, and so forth). In such cases using zone-sync instead would give better results. Enabling zone-sync will suppress this setting. |

| `waf.apBundleSource.retryAttempts` | `integer` | RetryAttempts is the number of retry attempts on transient failure. Range 1–10. |
| `waf.apBundleSource.secret` | `string` | Secret is the name of a Kubernetes Secret in the same namespace as the Policy. For HTTPS: kubernetes.io/tls (tls.crt + tls.key for client mTLS; optional ca.crt for server CA). For N1C: nginx.com/waf-bundle Secret with a 'token' field containing the API token. For NIM: nginx.com/waf-bundle Secret with a 'token' field (bearer auth) or 'username'+'password' fields (basic auth). |
| `waf.apBundleSource.timeout` | `string` | Timeout is the per-request HTTP timeout. Default 60s. |
| `waf.apBundleSource.trustedCertSecret` | `string` | TrustedCertSecret is the name of a Kubernetes Secret with a custom CA certificate for verifying the remote endpoint TLS certificate. The secret must be in the same namespace as the Policy, must be of type nginx.org/ca, and must include ca.crt. |
| `waf.apBundleSource.type` | `string` | Type is the bundle source backend. Defaults to HTTPS. Allowed values: `"HTTPS"`, `"NIM"`, `"N1C"`. |
| `waf.apBundleSource.url` | `string` | URL is the full bundle URL for HTTPS type, or the API base URL for NIM/N1C. Must use https://. |
| `waf.apBundleSource.verifyChecksum` | `boolean` | VerifyChecksum enables SHA-256 verification of the downloaded bundle. HTTPS type only. |
| `waf.apPolicy` | `string` | The App Protect WAF policy of the WAF. Accepts an optional namespace. Mutually exclusive with apBundle and apBundleSource. |
| `waf.enable` | `boolean` | Enables NGINX App Protect WAF. |
| `waf.securityLog` | `object` | SecurityLog defines the security log of a WAF policy. Mutual exclusivity of apLogConf, apLogBundle, and apLogBundleSource is enforced by the Go validation layer. |
